# Surreal Docs

Here I try to get more explanation for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com). SurrealDB has a pretty [Documentation](https://surrealdb.com/docs), but actually miss some important explanations like Scopes.
I will try here to collect these explanations from SurrealDB Discord Groups and other sources on the Internet.

Visit the docs [here](https://studioalex.github.io/surrealdocs/)

Everybody is welcome to participate in this challenge by adding his knowledge. Every kind of explanation and examples are welcome.

If you are new to SurrealDB please read the SurrealDB [Documentation](https://surrealdb.com/docs) first.
